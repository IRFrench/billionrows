# Attempt

My attempt at the billion rows challange.

## Idea

My idea is to have every single section, package, function in a place where it can be added to a test and benchmark, giving the most visibility of what everything does and where it can be improved

This will need to be the case because printing to stout is slow, no time to waste on that..

## Stats

11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz

Pretty sure its Duel core... I'll test with something more powerful later on.

8GB of RAM
